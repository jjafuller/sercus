# Sercus

Have you every wanted to any of these things?

- a directory of all applications running in the ecosystem
  
  - what is the current health
  
  - who manages it
  
  - where is the documentation (guidebook, readme, runbook, etc.)
  
  - what version are we running
  
  - links to monitoring dashboards
  
  - links repos(s)
  
  - what are the relationships between the applications (plus the ability to generate dependency graphs in the eco-system)

- an audit log of every deployment in every environment
  
  - who deployed it
  
  - who wrote the change that was deployed
  
  - when it happened
  
  - git sha
  
  - docker image sha
  
  - link to the log of the actual deployment

- reminders for when architectural and security reviews should be performed

If yes then Sercus is here to help.
